Service Grid 2.0
================

The Service Grid 2.0 project is a clean slate implementation for deployment and monitoring orchestration of services installed on the cloud.
It is a clean rewrite of Service Grid 1.0 which is the heart of the Cloudify project.

Service Grid Management Overview
--------------------------------
The SG management contains three components

* Deployment Planner - Maps services to machines, based on the capacity requirements of each service.
* Orchestrator - Deploys and monitors the services according to deployment plan.
* Capacity Planner - Monitors the services and changes the capacity requirements of services
* Agent - Uploads service deployment progress and service monitoring progress

```
