Service Grid 2.0
================

The Service Grid 2.0 project is a clean slate implementation for deployment and monitoring orchestration of services installed on the cloud.
It is a clean rewrite of Service Grid 1.0 which is the heart of the Cloudify project.

Service Grid Overview
--------------------------------
SG contains the following components:

* Capacity Planner - Monitors the services and changes the capacity requirements of services
* Deployment Planner - Maps services to machines, based on the capacity requirements of each service.
* Orchestrator - Sends command to start machines/agents/services according to deployment plan.
* Machine Provisioner - Starts new machines and installs the agent on them.
* Agent - Starts services and uploads service deployment state and service monitoring
